Hello there! 

I am Dragoș Ezaru, senior test engineer, based in Bucharest, Romania. Since starting down this path in 2019, I specialized on manual testing web, desktop and mobile apps, website design, both web and mobile.

Before becoming a test engineer, I dabbled in sales, accounting, the hospitality industry, banking and trade credit insurance and limited liability companies administration. These experiences, both in Romania and in the United States of America, offered me great knowledge in different domains which I can use now as a software tester, but I am also very interested in testing domains which are new to me.

I am fond of testing interesting software and hardware of all kinds and I look forward to help you have happy users.

That being said, I kindly ask that you give me a chance to be part of your project and I promise that there will be no escape for any bugs.

Fun fact: Romanian test engineers recommend eating garlic for better bug hunts, not just to scare vampires!
